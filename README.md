# Crime-Rate-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on predicting crime rates.
The process involves:

EDA: To explore and preprocess the data, understand distributions, and uncover correlations.
Linear Regression: To model the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable (crime_rate) for prediction purposes.
